Emulate travis to test application before pushing to git
--------------------------------------------------------

Travis emulator can emulate TravisCi parsing the **.travis.yml** file in local Linux machine.
You can test your application before pushing code to github.com web site.

Travis emulator can creates all the build declared in **.travis.yml**; all the builds are executed in sequential way.
The directory ~/travis_log (see -l switch) keeps the logs of all then build created.
Please note that log file is a binary file with escape ANSI screen code.
If you want to see the log use the following command:

    `less -R ~/travis_log/<build_name>.log`

A travis build executes the following steps:

* Initialize from local .travis.conf (not in travis-ci.org)
* Optional install packages `apt addons` (emulatore makes just the check)
* Optional install packages `cache`
* Set global values `env global`
* Execute code `before_install`
* Execute matrix initialization, included python version
* Execute build code `install`
* Execute build code `before_script`
* Execute build code `script`
* Execute build `before_cache` (only if cache is effective, not emulated)
* Execute build code `after_success` (emulated) or `after_failure` (not emulated)
* Optional code `before_deploy` (only if deployment is effective, not emulated)
* Optional code `deploy` (not emulated)
* Optional code `after_deploy` (only if deployment is effective, not emulated)
* Execute code `after_script` (not emulated)
* Wep from local .travis.conf (not in travis-ci.org)
