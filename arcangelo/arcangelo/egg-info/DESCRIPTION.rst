arcangelo: python edit utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**arcangelo** is an automatic editor for mass building python source code.
**arcangelo** is used to perform basic text transformation based on user rules.
While in some ways is similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as
ed or sed), **arcangelo** operates by making change command from rule files.
Rule files are simple yaml files, read by arcangelo which apply these rules to every line of files processed.

In this way migration workflow is very simple, accurate, precise and fast.
