arcangelo: python edit utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**arcangelo** is an automatic editor for transforming python source code.
**arcangelo** is used to perform basic text transformation based on user rules.
While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as
ed or sed), **arcangelo** works by making editor command from rule files.
Rule files are simple yaml files, read by arcangelo which try to apply all rules
to all lines of files processed.

In this way migration workflow is very simple, accurate, precise and fast.
