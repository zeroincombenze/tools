.SH NAME
lisa \- create and/or manage a LAMP and/or Odoo server
.SH SYNOPSIS
lisa [options] actions packages [param]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlisa\fR means Linux Install Simplifier App; it is an interactive tool to
install, update, remove, query and manage software for building a complete LAMP
and/or Odoo server.
.br
LAMP means \fBLinux\fR \fIApache\fR \fIMysql\fR (now \fIMariadb\fR) \fIPHP\fR;
in recent times, \fIPython\fR and \fIPostgresql\fR were added.
.br
Please pay attention to package name you type may be replaced by \fBlisa\fR
in order to build the right environment, everytime and everywhere;
replacement dependes by Linux distribution and version:
i.e. when you type \fIlisa install apache2\fR and your
machine is running CentOS, your command is replaced by \fIlisa install httpd\fR
because apache2 package is named httpd on CentOS.
.br
\fBlisa\fR is just a front-end for \fIrpm\fR, \fIyum\fR, \fIdpkg\fR, \fIapt-get\fR,
\fIpip\fR, \fIgit\fR, \fIwget\fR and other commands, it is not a real installer package.
It requires \fByum\fR on CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux family distros,
\fBapt-get\fR on Ubuntu and Debian family distros. May be \fBlisa\fR installs
some other package if required by installation process, like \fBpip\fR or \fBgit\fR
or \fBwget\fR.
.br
\fBlisa\fR is very useful to manage all the packages needed to build a complete
LAMP server and/or Odoo server and to check the real installation status.

\fBlisa\fR retrieves information about package from package configuration file.
It is a simple text file, named PKGNAME.lish where PKGNAME is the name of package;
i.e. apache2.lish (everywhere you see PKGNAME in this help, replace PKGNAME with
real package name you will manage)
.br
You can easily build your personal package and distribute your software.
Package configuration file describes your package, dependencies and installation
requirement in simple way so you can easily edit one
.br
See /etc/lisa/lisa.conf.sample to understand how to build your package configuration file.
.br
All operations are traced in \fI/var/log/lisa.log\fR; switch -L can set another tracelog.
.br
Using -n switch, you can simply use \fIlisa\fR just to see which command you
should issue to manage PKGNAME software. If you use the tool stdout2wiki you can
write your installation script or your documentation about installation.


Action is one of:
.br
* help
.br
* install PKGNAME
.br
* update PKGNAME
.br
* config PKGNAME
.br
* remove PKGNAME
.br
* status PKGNAME
.br
* version PKGNAME
.br
* whatis PKGNAME
.br
* tellme PKGNAME parameter
.br
* info PKGNAME
.br
* build PKGNAME
.br
.br
You can issue more actions separated by plus simbol: i.e. \fBinstall+config\fR
.br
You can manage many packages in every single command line; package names must be
separated by comma: i.e. \fBapache2,php5\fR
.br
.br
lisa supports package name using a requirement specifier.
Generally speaking, a requirement specifier is composed of a required package name
followed by optional version specifiers and optional installer. i.e:
.br
\fBlisa install 'odoo>=7.0<10.0!!pip'\fR
.br
Use quotes around package name with specifiers in the shell
because >, <, and ! are processed by shell itself.
Specified version, in this version of lisa, may be ignored by actual installer software;
currently is supported by pip.
Token !! (double exclamation mark) declare a different installer, if package
may be installed by different software (i.e. yum/apt-get or pip or git)

\fBinstall\fR
.RS
Install selected package(s); before install every package, requirements are checked.
Requirements are declared by \fIReqPkgList\fR parameter, comma separated in
configuration file. The standard installers apt-get and yum must not be declared;
pip, wget, git and other installer software must be declared in order to install package.
.br
With package, may be installed some sub packages, declared by by \fIBOP\fR
parameter, comma separated in configuration file.
.br
If a package is already installed, is ignored and sub packages are not examined.
This behaviour  may be changed by -e switch. Sub packages may nested.
To install package, \fBlisa\fR choices one of \fIyum\fR, \fIapt-get\fR,
\fIpip\fR or other installer software.
.br
See http://wiki.zeroincombenze.org/en/Lisa page for furthermore informations.
.br
With optional switch -D and -w, also other packages are added to installation list.
If package name is LAMP, \fBlisa\fR installes a full server and gcc compiler.
.br
When Odoo is required, \fBlisa\fR installes git and issue \fIgit clone\fR command
from github.com in two ways:
.br
1. If -D switch is set (development environment), Odoo is installed and
deployed with full history in \fB/opt/odoo/\fR\fIver\fR where \fIver\fR is
6.1, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0 or 12.0;
.br
2. If no development enviroment is set by -D switch, Odoo
is installed without history in \fB/opt/odoo/\fR\fIver\fR, where \fIver\fR is
6.1, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0 or 12.0;
.br
The -o switch must be declared to select Odoo repository to clone (see -o option)
.br
The -l switch add localization module during installation; see -l option
.br
The -s switch add sub-module during installation; see -s option
.RE
.br

.br
\fBupdate\fR
.RS

Depending sub packages will be updated/upgraded too, or installed if needed
in order to align package installation.
Optional switch -D and -w can include more packages to update.
.br
This action may be also used to add development packages; i.e. after issued \fIlisa install LAMP\fR
a full LAMP server is created without development packages. Typing \fIlisa -D update LAMP\fR adds
development packages.
.br
When Odoo is required, \fBlisa\fR update issuing \fIgit pull origin\fR command from github.com
.br
To update submodules use -l and -s switches
